# Deployment Script
# Version: 1.0.0
# Date: 2025-07-29
# ==============================================================================
#
# Description:
# This script performs a zero-downtime deployment for a specific project.
# It is designed to be called by the `deployment_poller.sh` script.
#
# It updates the image tag in the project's docker-compose.yml, pulls the
# new image from the local registry, and redeploys the service.
#
# Usage:
#   This script is not intended to be run manually.
#   The poller will execute it like this:
#   ./deploy.sh <project_name> <new_version_tag> <registry_port>
#
